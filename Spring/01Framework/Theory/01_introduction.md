# Spring is a Dependency injection framework to make java application loosely coupled.

javaEE = java Enterprise Edition.

it was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003.


__what is Dependacy injection__
in old days we used to create new method & object for each desired method using new keyword but this makes the application tightly coupled
spring automatically takes care of all the fuss when we inject the dependancy above our method. this is known as inversion of control
